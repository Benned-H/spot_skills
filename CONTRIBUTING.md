# How to Contribute to `spot_skills`

## Typical Workflow

This section outlines a general workflow for contributing to `spot_skills` and related codebases.

### 1. Set Up the Local Development Environment

- **Clone the repository and submodules using SSH**:

  ```bash
  git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:Benned-H/spot_skills.git
  cd spot_skills
  ```

- **Activate the Docker environment (builds or pulls the necessary image)**:

  ```bash
  bash docker/launch.sh
  ```

  You can use this script whenever you want to enter the Docker container.

### 2. Create a Feature Branch

When you begin a "new task," create a branch on GitHub to track the effort. We're following a [feature branch](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureBranch.html) style of development where changes are only integrated into the `main` branch once they're working.

- **Sync with `main`**:

  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git pull origin main
  ```

- **Create a new feature branch**:

  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/<branch-name>
  ```

### 3. Push Early and Create a Draft Pull Request

- **Stage and commit initial changes** (even if minimal or experimental):

  ```bash
  git add <changed-files>
  git commit -m "Initial commit for <branch-name>"
  ```

- **Push to the remote**:

  ```bash
  git push origin feature/<branch-name>
  ```

- **Open a Draft Pull Request**:

  - Create a PR on GitHub right away and mark it as a "Draft."
  - Add a minimal description and focus on a **"Done When"** logic: A simple sentence explaining what outcome the reviewer should expect when the PR is considered "done."
  - Example:
    > "Done When: Spot robot can successfully execute the new pick-and-place skill without error in the simulated environment."

### 4. Make Frequent Atomic Commits

- **Implement and commit code iteratively**:

  - Keep commits atomic and frequent. Each commit should reflect one logical change or update:
    ```bash
    git add <specific-files>
    git commit -m "Add X feature for task Y"
    ```

- **Push frequently** to keep the remote branch up-to-date:

  ```bash
  git push origin feature/<branch-name>
  ```

- Use the Draft PR for **self-review** and iteration.

### 5. Test the Changes

- **Run tests locally** if they are available. If not, testing tools are optional for future use.
  ```bash
  # Run any available tests inside the container
  pytest --cov=<path>  # Optional, if tests exist
  ```

### 6. Iterate on the Draft PR

- Use GitHubâ€™s **Review Tools** to leave comments and iterate on the code while the PR is in draft mode.
- Continue making changes in the feature branch, pushing frequently.
  ```bash
  git push origin feature/<branch-name>
  ```

### 7. Mark PR as Ready for Review

- Once the feature is complete, mark the Draft PR as **"Ready for Review."**
  - Ensure the "Done When" statement is still accurate.
  - Example:
    > "Done When: Spot can execute the grasp skill reliably on a detected object."

### 8. Code Review Process

- The project lead will review the PR and provide feedback.

- **Respond to feedback** with additional commits, and update the PR as needed.

- **Push revisions**:

  ```bash
  git push origin feature/<branch-name>
  ```

### 9. Merging to Main

Once approved:

- The project lead merges the feature branch into `main`, typically with **rebase and merge** to maintain clean history.
- **Update submodules** if necessary:
  ```bash
  git submodule update --remote
  ```

### 10. Cleanup

- **Delete the feature branch** locally and remotely once merged:
  ```bash
  git branch -d feature/<branch-name>
  git push origin --delete feature/<branch-name>
  ```
